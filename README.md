# Intraspecific
=====================

This file discribed the methods of the manuscript about intraspecific diveristy study.

The aims of this project: 
---------------------------------
* to test the clinal patterns of each intraspecific trait variation by all genotypes collected from all over the world.
* to test the phenotypic plasticity between two common gardens and the clinal pattern of plasticity.
* to assess the causes of bioclimatic environments on gene-based intraspecific variability.

Methods:
---------------------------------
1. All data were tested the distribution patterns.
2. Assess the correlationship between all measured functional traits and between the geographical and bioclimatic variables og genotypic origins.
3. SEM modelled the general cause- result relationship among intraspecifc variability, geographical variables and bioclimatic variables.
4. Test the detail relationship between each functional traits and latitudes of origins by (generalized) linear mixed model and draw the linear or Quadratic relations.
5. Test the detail relationship between each functional traits and bioclimatic variables by (generalized) linear mixed model followed by AICc selection for the best model.
6. Random forest models used for selecting the most inportant bioclimatic variables for each traits and drawing the partial dependence plots of each selected bioclimatic variables.
